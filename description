🤖 Maze-Solving Robot with Arduino & Raspberry Pi
🚀 Autonomous Maze-Solving Robot that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) for pathfinding, real-time Pygame visualization, and Bluetooth communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

🔹 Features
✅ BFS Pathfinding – Efficient algorithm to solve the maze
✅ Real-Time Visualization – Uses Pygame to track the robot’s movement
✅ Arduino Control – Handles motor movement and ultrasonic sensor readings
✅ Bluetooth Communication – Sends movement commands via HC-06 module
✅ EEPROM Storage – Saves learned paths for optimized future runs

🔍 Technologies Used
Arduino Uno (Motor control, sensor data processing)
Raspberry Pi (Path planning, Bluetooth communication)
Python (PySerial, Pygame for visualization)
C++ (Arduino IDE) (Low-level motor control)
🚀 How It Works
Arduino reads distances using an ultrasonic sensor and sends data to Raspberry Pi.
Raspberry Pi calculates the shortest path using BFS and visualizes the maze.
HC-06 Bluetooth module transmits movement commands to Arduino.
Arduino controls the motors to move the robot based on the computed path.
